    <h1>Gracie Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h1>
    <p>Brazilian jiu-jitsu  (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling with particular emphasis on ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was developed from Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of Japanese individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, Soshihiro Satake, and Isao Okano. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of judo.
      BJJ is founded on the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.[5] Sparring (commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ is considered a martial art, a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and building character, and a way of life

    <h1>Open Blockchain / Bitcoin</h1>
    <p>Bitcoin is the first decentralized electronic cash payment network that enables value to be transferred peer-to-peer. Unlike traditional payment networks, Bitcoin bypasses the need for a centralized body of control, such as a government or a central bank. Instead, activities and balances are stored on a public, shared ledger called the blockchain, which is verified by thousands of computers (called nodes) maintaining the network across the globe. Transactions are made with no middlemen so anyone with access to the Internet can transfer money to anybody anywhere in the world.
      I’ll be using the terms: Bitcoin (capital B) to reference Bitcoin’s protocol/network and bitcoin (lowercase b) to reference Bitcoin’s currency
      “Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.”
      – Satoshi Nakamoto
